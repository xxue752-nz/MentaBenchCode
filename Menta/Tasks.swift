            DEPRESSION INDICATORS (Classify as 1):
            - Persistent sadness: "always sad", "can't stop crying", "feel hopeless"
            - Loss of interest: "nothing matters", "don't care about anything", "lost motivation"
            - Worthlessness: "I'm worthless", "hate myself", "I'm a failure"
            - Fatigue: "always tired", "no energy", "exhausted all the time"
            - Sleep issues: insomnia, oversleeping, irregular sleep patterns
            - Appetite changes: significant weight loss/gain, eating disorders
            - Concentration problems: "can't focus", "brain fog", "forgetful"
            - Suicidal ideation: thoughts of death, self-harm, ending life
            
            NOT DEPRESSED INDICATORS (Classify as 0):
            - Temporary sadness with clear triggers and recovery
